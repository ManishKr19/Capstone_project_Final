Introduction Section :\n##### Discussion of the business problem and the audience who would be interested in this project.\n#### 1.1 Scenario and Background\nI am a knowledge individual presently residing in Downtown Singapore. I presently live inside walking distance to Downtown \"Telok Ayer MRT underground station\" so I even have access to smart public transportation to figure. Likewise, I fancy several amenities within the neighborhood, like international preparation restaurants, cafes, food shops, and recreation. I have been offered a good chance to figure in Manhattan, NY. though i'm terribly excited concerning it, i'm a small amount stress toward the method to secure a comparable place to measure in Manhattan. Therefore, call} to use the learned skills throughout the Coursera course to explore ways that to form certain my decision is factual and appreciated. Of course, there square measure alternatives to attain the solution exploitation on the market Google and Social media tools, however it appreciated doing it myself with learned tools.\n\n#### 1.2 Problem to be resolved:\nThe challenge to resolve is having the ability to search out a rental lodging unit in Manhattan Empire State that provides similar characteristics and advantages to my current scenario. Therefore, so as to line a basis for comparison, i would like to search out a rental unit subject to the subsequent conditions:\n\nlodging with min a pair of bedrooms with monthly rent to not exceed US$7000/month\nUnit situated inside walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway railway line station in Manhattan\nthe realm with amenities and venues like those delineated for current location(See item a pair of.1)\n\n#### 1.3 Interested Audience:\nI believe this can be a relevant project for someone or entity considering moving to a serious town in Europe, the United States or Asia since the approach and methodologies used here area unit applicable all told cases. the utilization of FourSquare information and mapping techniques combined with information analysis can facilitate resolve the key queries arisen. Lastly, this project could be a smart follow case toward the event of knowledge Science skills.\n"

Data Section:\n##### Description of the data and its sources that will be used to solve the problem\n#### 2.1 Data of Current Situation\nI presently reside within the neighborhood of 'Mccallum Street' in Downtown Singapore. I use Foursquare to spot the venues round the space of residence that square measure then shown within the Singapore map shown in methodology and execution in section three.0. It is a reference for comparison with the required future location in Manhattan American state\n\n#### 2.2 Data Required to resolve the problem\nIn order to form a decent selection of an identical lodging in Manhattan New York State, the subsequent knowledge is required: List/Information on neighborhoods from Manhattan with their Geodata ( latitude and meridian. List/Information regarding the subway underground stations in Manhattan with geodata. Listed residences for rent in Manhattan space with descriptions ( what percentage beds, price, location, address) Venues and amenities within the Manhattan neighborhoods (e.g. top 10). \n#### 2.3 sources and manipulation \nThe list of Manhattan neighborhoods is discovered throughout the science laboratory exercise throughout the course. A CSV file was created which is able to be browse so as to make an information frame and its mapping. The CSV file 'mh_neigh_data.csv' has the subsequent organization. The file are going to be directly browse to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and area savings. The cluster of neighborhoods and mapping are going to be shown, however. associate rule was accustomed confirm the geodata from Nominatim. the particular rule cryptography could also be shown in 'markdown' mode as a result of it takes time to run.\n\nmh_neigh_data.tail():\n\n          Borough    Neighborhood    Latitude    Longitude\n\n      35    Manhattan    Turtle Bay    40.752042    -73.967708\n\n      36    Manhattan    Tudor City    40.746917    -73.971219\n\n      37    Manhattan    Stuyvesant Town    40.731000    -73.974052\n\n      38    Manhattan    Flatiron    40.739673    -73.990947\n\n      39    Manhattan    Hudson Yards    40.756658    -74.000111\n\nA list of Manhattan subway railway stops complied with Numbers (Apple excel) and it had been completed with Wikipedia information ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_stations_in_Manhattan) and data from New York Transit authority and Google maps (https://www.google.com/maps/search/manhattan+subway+metro+stations/@40.7837297,-74.1033043,11z/data=!3m1!4b1) for a final consolidated list of subway stop names and their address.

The CSV file \"nnnn.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorithm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. The actual algorithm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode because it takes time to run. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim(), it was possible to determine the latitude and longitude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorithms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0\n\n\"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points, as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius. Foursquare is used to find the avenues at Manhattan neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending on the location shown.\n\n#### 2.4 How the data will be used to solve the problem\nThe data are going to be used as follows:\n\nUse Foursquare and geopy information to map the highest ten venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in teams ( as per Course LAB).\n\nUse foursquare and geopy information to map the placement of subway subway stations, individually and on high of the above-clustered map so as to be able to determine the venues and amenities close to every subway station, or explore every subway location individually.\n\nUse Foursquare and geopy information to map the placement of rental places, in some type, connected to the subway locations.\n\ncreate a map that depicts, as an example, the typical rental value per sq. foot, around a radius of one.0 mile (1.6 km) around every depot - or similar metrics. {i will|i will be able to|i'll} be able to quickly purpose to the popups to understand the relative value per subway space.\n\nAddresses from rental locations are going to be reborn to geodata( striated muscle, long) victimization Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\n\nData are going to be searched in open information sources if out there, from land sites if hospitable reading, libraries or alternative government agencies like subway ny MTA, etc.\n\n#### 2.5 Mapping of Data\nThe following maps were created to facilitate the analysis and therefore the selection of the palace to measure. Manhattan map of Neighborhoods Manhattan subway subway locations, Manhattan map of places for rent. Manhattan map of clustered venues and neighborhoods. Combined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations Combined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations and venues clusters\n"

Apt 1 is located 400 meters from subway station at 59th Street and work place ( Park Ave and 53rd) is another 600 meters way. I can walk to work place and use subway for other places aroung. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 2 and it is located in a fine district in the East side of Manhattan.\n\n#### Apartment 2 rent cost is US6935, just under the US7000 budget. Apt 2 is located 60 meters from subway station at Fulton Street, but I will have to ride the subway daily to work , possibly 40-60 min ride. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 3\n\n### Based on current Singapore venues, I feel that Cluster 2 type of venues is a closer resemblance to my current place. That means that apartment 1 is a better choice since the extra monthly rent is worth the conveniences it provides."
